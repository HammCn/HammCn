# ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ Hi bro

### My name is Hamm, it's my shit-code repositories here.

I am a product designer&developer from ```ChongQing, China```. 

I'm focusing on web technology and operation skill on the Linux server side.

After work, I'm also interested in driving, photographing, swimming, cooking and playing games.

You can get more information from [My HomePage](https://hamm.cn), but [Email](mailto:admin@hamm.cn) will be the quickest way to contact me.

I wish you enjoy your codes and fuck your bugs

That's all and nice to meet you.
